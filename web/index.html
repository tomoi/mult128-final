            <h1>Web Development</h1>
            <p>When I build a website, I start by planning out the aspects in Figma (rip Adobe Xd). This is to ensure I
                have a solid plan before I start so I'm not stuck in the middle wondering what to do next.</p>

                <h2>Planning for this site</h2>
                <p>This site was made in a bit of a rush. Since it was a final project at the end of the school year, I
                    had 3 or 4 other projects due around the same time.</p>

                    <p>This is the very high-quality drawing I made to plan this website. I blocked out how I wanted the
                        content to be displayed, and wrote reminders underneath and around.</p>

                    <p>I wanted to get the nav bar to look visually appealing so I decided to build it in Figma
                        beforehand. I was trying different things to decide how I wanted the hover and active states to
                        look. <br>Obviously some changes were made in development.<br>

                    <p>I brainstorm so I can decide what content goes where beforehand. This helps with clarity and
                        makes sure the pages aren't cluttered.</p>

                    <p>I use Adobe Color to pick the colours for my webpages. Since this is my personal website, I made
                        the colour scheme my favorite colour, green. I also use Adobe Color to check my colour scheme
                        for accessibility, in terms of contrast and colour blind safety.</p>
